# Maze-Solver

Maze Solver using Python for [boot.dev](https://boot.dev), course 10 on the Python track.

This follows on from the Data Structures and Algorithms module within the course, so is good practice for DFS.

## Technologies Used

- Python (of course!)
- Tkinter

## Lessons learned

1. This was my first time implementing a DFS, and so was a little confusing at first. However, simply renaming a few variables to be more appropriate than just `i` and `j` really helped to follow and understand the flow. You can't forget the importance of documenting your code through propper naming.
